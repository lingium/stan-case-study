# Stan case study

This repository is for the Stan case study: adding a new distribution to Stan with analytic derivatives.

This case study is written originally in LaTeX for more beautiful typography and can be converted to other formats via `pandoc` to enhance distribute.

The [tex source code](/docs/maindoc.tex) can be conveted to markdown by running

```shell
pandoc "maindoc.tex" -o "maindoc.md" --wrap=none
```

The [markdown version](/docs/maindoc.md) can be previewed directly on Github.
